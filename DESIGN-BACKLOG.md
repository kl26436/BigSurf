---

## 🔴 Phase A — Critical bugs ✅ COMPLETE

**All 6 critical bugs fixed.** Phase A shipped in one session — see [Phase A follow-up item in Phase B] for the optional BW-delta goal-setting feature.

- [x] **Unit-toggle button now shows the *active* unit** at [active-workout-ui.js:354](js/core/workout/active-workout-ui.js#L354). Also bumped font from 0.55rem → `--font-2xs` and added `--primary-bg` fill + primary border to look like an affordance (closes a Phase B WCAG item too).
- [x] **Insight card no longer dismisses on tap-anywhere.** Explicit `.dash-insight__close` button added to [dashboard-ui.js:342](js/core/ui/dashboard-ui.js#L342) with 32px tap target; card-level handler removed.
- [x] **Body-weight delta neutralized** — `.hero-chip__delta.up/.down` now use `--text-muted` in [dashboard-v2.css:96](styles/pages/dashboard-v2.css#L96). Gain/loss color-coding removed so the app doesn't assume a goal direction.
- [x] **Done vs Current pill differentiated** — `.aw-pill.done` is now a check-outline (transparent bg, success border/text); `.aw-pill.current` stays solid primary. Preserves `--highlight-warm` exclusively for superset context.
- [x] **History: "+ Add Missing" demoted** to a `.btn-icon-sm` (`fa-plus` only) at [index.html:262](index.html#L262). Primary CTA is now reserved for browsing intent.
- [x] **History: Calendar day cells tappable again.** Removed the §8e override that stripped `.has-workout` to transparent. Base rule (`--primary-bg-subtle` fill + cursor:pointer + `scale(0.95)` active) now applies. Today still gets primary border.

### Follow-ups (moved to Phase B)

- [ ] **BW delta goal-setting** (deferred from Phase A #3). Add `weightGoal: 'lose' | 'gain' | 'maintain'` to `preferences/settings`, wire into onboarding as an optional question, and re-enable colored `.up` / `.down` deltas based on goal. Default stays neutral.

---

## 🟡 Phase B — High-impact usability ✅ COMPLETE (+ BW delta goal-setting follow-up shipped)

### Active Workout ✅

- [x] **Two kebab menus differentiated** — workout-scope uses `fa-ellipsis-v`; exercise-hero now uses `fa-cog` with `aria-label="Edit exercise"` ([active-workout-ui.js:344](js/core/workout/active-workout-ui.js#L344)).
- [x] **Back button** switched from `fa-chevron-left` → `fa-times` with `aria-label="Exit workout"`.
- [x] **Autofill hint gated** to once per workout session — `AppState._autofillHintShown` flag reset in [workout-session.js:1086](js/core/workout/workout-session.js#L1086) on each workout start.
- [x] **BW banner tokenized + `.bw-banner__chev` class** replaces inline chevron style. Base state uses `--cat-shoulders-bg` token.
- [x] **Equipment sheet empty states consistent** — all three sections now render placeholder text when empty (non-search); empties hidden during search. Inline-style offenders removed via new classes: `.aw-equip-section__empty`, `.js-row__icon--equip`, `.js-row__loc-icon`, `.js-row--none`.
- [x] **Add-exercise truncation hint** — "Showing 50 of N — refine your search" footer when results exceed cap.
- [x] **New-equipment chip default is category-aware** — new `guessEquipmentType()` helper maps exercise name/category to likely type (Bench Press → Barbell, Plank → Bodyweight, etc.).
- [x] **Superset completed-exercise affordance** redesigned — `.js-row--done` shows strike-through name + `.js-row__done-pill` ("Done") instead of a green check (which read as "selected").
- [x] **Notes textarea auto-grows** via new `awAutoGrowNotes()` handler; auto-sizes on initial render too.
- [x] **Unit-toggle WCAG fix** — shipped in Phase A (font bumped to `--font-2xs`).
- [x] **Inline `position: relative` on `.aw-body`** moved to CSS; added a pill-color-semantics doc comment at the top of `active-workout-v2.css`.

### Dashboard ✅

- [x] **Avatar shows first-initial** of user's displayName (or email) — no more empty placeholder circle.
- [x] **Stale muscle opacity** eased from `0.55` → `0.85`. `.stale-warn` text + sort order carries the signal.
- [x] **Composition label unified** — always reads "Composition" (was flipping between "Body"/"Composition").
- [x] **`.bp-card__icon` bumped** 26px → 32px with `--font-sm` (was `--font-xs`).
- [x] **Weekday derivation centralized** — new `getDayName(date, format)` helper in [date-helpers.js](js/core/utils/date-helpers.js); dashboard `renderForToday` uses it.

### History ✅

- [x] **Calendar ↔ list linkage** — calendar day tap now also scrolls the matching list row into view and flashes `.is-selected` for 1.5s (`flashListRowForDate`).
- [x] **Month nav sticky** with bg-app background; month context survives scroll.
- [x] **Search + filter inline** — grid `1fr auto` layout; filter select hugs content.
- [x] **Status pill semantics** — incomplete now uses `fa-circle-half-stroke`; cancelled is muted gray (`--bg-card-hi` + `--text-muted`), no longer error-coded red.
- [x] **List row status pill reduced** 28px → 20px; font `--font-xs` → `--font-2xs`.
- [x] **Cancelled-state unified across calendar + list** — both use muted gray; calendar `.cal-icon--cancelled` uses `--text-muted` + `0.6` opacity (was `0.25`).

### Follow-up shipped

- [x] **BW delta goal-setting** — `weightGoal: 'lose' | 'maintain' | 'gain' | null` added to `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`; Settings page has a segmented control to pick it ("Off / Lose / Maintain / Gain"); dashboard `.hero-chip__delta` tints `--good` / `--bad` via `getBwDeltaDirectionClass()` only when a goal is set. Default stays neutral.

---

## 🟢 Phase C — Visual hierarchy / minor polish ✅

### Active Workout ✅

- [x] **Current-set single signal** — `.aw-set-row.current` keeps primary border only; removed the competing `box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px var(--primary-bg)` (three-signal overload) and bumped border-width to 1.5px so it still pops.
- [x] **Elapsed time promoted** — new `.aw-title__elapsed` with `--font-xs` + weight 700 leading the meta row ("22:14 · Exercise 3/7"). Timer tick updates surgically.
- [x] **Unit toggle without full re-render** — `awToggleUnit()` mutates DOM in place (unit button, weight column label, weight inputs — skipping the input that has focus). Added `data-set-idx` / `data-field` attrs to set rows for targeted selection.
- [x] **`.input-error` inline message** — `.field__error` class added to fields.css; new-equipment form appends "Name required" below the input on empty-name submit + focuses the input.
- [x] **Equipment auto-associate toast** — `showNotification` after successful Firestore write: *"Added {equipName} to {locName}"* (silent, 2.5s).
- [x] **Pill row scroll fade** — `mask-image: linear-gradient(...)` on `.aw-pills` fades edges 14px to hint scrollability.
- [x] **Footer "All" lifted** — `.aw-footer__list-btn` bg `--bg-card` → `--bg-card-hi`; text `--text-main` → `--text-strong`.
- [x] **`transition: all` sweep** — shipped in Phase D for `.aw-set-row` (and 6 other hot-path rules).
- [x] **Rest-timer overlay tokens** — added `--rest-timer-overlay` + `--rest-timer-overlay-strong` to tokens.css; 3 raw rgba literals in active-workout-v2.css replaced.
- [x] **"Add set" toned down** — `.aw-add-set` padding 10px → 8px, font-size `--font-sm` → `--font-xs`, font-weight 600 → 500.
- [x] **BW banner chevron class** — shipped in Phase B (`.bw-banner__chev`).
- [x] **Pill color doc comment** — shipped in Phase D at the top of active-workout-v2.css.

### Dashboard ✅

- [x] **Label sizes** — `.bp-cell__label` and `.hero-chip__label` already use `--font-2xs` (shipped in Sprint 2).
- [x] **"Most used" threshold** — changed from `count > 3` → `isMostUsed && count >= 1` so the top template always carries the badge.
- [x] **Insight dismissed by content-hash** — added `hashInsight()` helper (stable DJB2-ish). `dismissInsight()` stores `insightDismissedHash` of the dismissed content; render checks `hash !== dismissedHash` (replaces the day-based check). A new insight tomorrow with different content resurfaces automatically.
- [x] **"For day → All →" plumbing** — `openWorkoutSelectorForDay(dayName)` exported + window-bound; sets `AppState._workoutSelectorDayFilter` before navigating. Selector consumption of the flag (sort by that day's frequency) is a follow-up if the UX wants it.
- [x] **`.bp-card__chev` → `.dash-chev`** renamed across JS + CSS (truthfully describes its role: a shared dashboard-row chevron).
- [x] **`.rw-*` → `.dash-template-*`** renamed — `.rw-row` / `.rw-icon` / `.rw-info` / `.rw-name` / `.rw-meta` / `.rw-count` / `.rw-play` all migrated across dashboard-ui.js, composition-detail-ui.js, and dashboard-v2.css.

### History ✅

- [x] **Legend conditional display** — hidden entirely when fewer than 4 distinct categories this month (icons are self-explanatory for small sets).
- [x] **`.btn-icon-sm` bumped** 36px → 40px (closer to `--tap` 44px for a11y).
- [x] **`.history-card` family deleted** — no JS/HTML references; ~65 LOC removed from history.css.
- [x] **Category derivation unified** — `formatWorkoutForCalendar` now prefers canonical `workout.category` field, falls back to substring inference only for legacy entries without one.
- [x] **`.calendar-container` radius drift** — resolved in Phase D via the same-file dedup pass.
- [x] **`.calendar-day.today` border drift** — resolved in Phase A's calendar-tappability fix.
- [x] **Row icon vs status pill competition** — reduced status pill 28px → 20px in Phase B; further "pick one" consolidation left as an explicit design decision (both are useful; not a bug).
- [x] **Load More inline style** — shipped in Phase B (`.btn-block` utility + `.recent-workouts-load-more` class).
- [~] **`.workout-picker-item` vs `.recent-workout-item`** — deliberate distinction documented: `.recent-workout-item` is the borderless list row under the calendar; `.workout-picker-item` is the bordered row inside the day-picker modal when a single date has multiple workouts. Different contexts, both needed.

---

## 🧹 Phase D — Cleanup ✅ (most items shipped; long-tail deferred)

### Shipped

- [x] **PAGES-REDESIGN alignment** — all 3 conflict resolutions:
  - forms.css disposition: existing file retained; spec doc updated with status note (§0 points to the actual component files).
  - `.btn-save` → `.page-header__save` BEM rename + solid-pill visual per spec. Atomic migration across all 6 callsites (index.html, equipment-library-ui, workout-management-ui, location-ui). `.btn-back` / `.back-btn` → `.page-header__back` (circular). `.header-left` → `.page-header__left`. `.page-title` → `.page-header__title` where nested in page-header.
  - `.field-label` adopts uppercase + `0.06em` letter-spacing per spec; added `.field-label__hint` and `.field-helper` helpers.
- [x] **workout.css audit** — `.section-header-row` family migrated to [page-header.css](styles/components/page-header.css). File marked DEPRECATED with a header comment listing remaining classes to migrate (exercise-card, exercise-list, exercise-overflow-item, modal-rest-*, cardio-*, notes-area, compact-hero). File is not imported in `index.css`; remaining classes currently render unstyled. Full deletion deferred to a future sprint.
- [x] **"New equipment" form inline styles** — 7 inline `style=` attrs replaced with `.field-label` + new `.aw-new-equip__base-row` / `__base-input` / `__base-unit` / `__location-hint` classes in [active-workout-v2.css](styles/pages/active-workout-v2.css).
- [x] **`transition: all` sweep** — 7 occurrences in active-workout-v2.css replaced with explicit property lists (hot-path only; workout.css occurrences left alone since the file is deprecated).
- [x] **Same-file duplicate classes consolidated** — `.month-navigation` (3→1 in history.css), `.recent-workout-name` (2→1), `.quick-add-chip` (2→1 in exercise-lib), `.exercise-card-meta` (2→1), `.skeleton` (removed dupes from nav.css + utilities.css, kept canonical in empty-states.css).
- [x] **Detail-page CSS gaps** — cross-referenced `dashboard-final-v2.html` against live files. Added preemptive `.sec-head` pattern to [page-header.css](styles/components/page-header.css) so Phase F pages can use it. Other "gaps" are naming-only (mockup uses `.greeting`, live uses `.dash-greeting` — same thing).
- [x] **Inline-style sweep pass** — `workout-history.js` detail modal: extracted the ~70-line inline-styled exercise card/table/notes/placeholder into a new `.wh-detail-*` family in [history.css](styles/pages/history.css). `style="` occurrences in workout-history.js: 59 (start) → 34 (Sprint 6) → **16** (now).
- [x] **Bug fix: SyntaxError on `awAutoGrowNotes` import** — Phase B added the export but missed re-exporting from [workout-core.js](js/core/workout/workout-core.js) (the main.js import shim). Fixed.

### Deferred / cross-file follow-ups

- [x] **Cross-file duplicate classes (tractable ones)** — `.exercise-unit-toggle` consolidated into modals.css (deleted from nav.css). `.quick-add-chip` templates.css declaration deleted (cascade-loser; exercise-lib.css is canonical). Remaining `.modal-rest-display` / `.exercise-card-meta` duplicates live in deprecated workout.css only — self-resolve when workout.css ships.
- [ ] **workout.css full deletion** — not imported, but live-referenced by many JS render functions (exercise-list, exercise-overflow-item, modal-rest-*, cardio-*, notes-area, compact-hero etc.). Currently renders unstyled. Deferred: requires visual validation per class and a dedicated migration sprint. See DEPRECATED header inside the file for the migration checklist.
- [x] **Chip/pill audit (findings documented)** — 15 variants counted. Dead classes removed: `.location-chip` (modals.css), `.recent-template-chip` family (templates.css). Undefined-but-referenced fixed: `.pill-btn` added to body-measurements.css (was unstyled in bodyweight chart time-range buttons). Remaining chips stay as-is: each has context-specific sizing/behavior (`aw-pill` is the wizard progress pill; `hero-chip` is a metric chip on the dashboard; `active-pill` is a workout-in-progress floating pill — all distinct). Consolidation into `chips.css` modifiers would require UX-level unification decisions and is **not recommended** as a mechanical refactor.
- [x] **Button variant audit (findings documented)** — 28 variants counted. Dead classes removed: `.btn-text-danger`, `.btn-save`/`.btn-back` (Phase D rename), plus earlier Sprint 7 deletions. Live but rarely-used (≤2 JS callsites): `.btn-start-small`, `.btn-reorder`, `.btn-dismiss`, `.btn-clear`, `.btn-add-equipment`, `.btn-delete-exercise`. These are context-specific — recommend evaluating each callsite's need for the custom styling before merging into the canonical 8 (`.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-ghost`, `.btn-icon`, `.btn-sm`/`.btn-small`, `.btn-danger`, `.btn-success`, `.btn-text`). No mechanical consolidation without product review.
- [x] **Inline-style sweep long-tail progress** — `workout-management-ui.js`: 35 → **0** (extracted template editor body, day-chip row, exercise-row + overflow menu, estimate stats, create-ex empty state into [templates.css](styles/pages/templates.css)). `location-ui.js`: 28 → **0** (extracted location-detail map card, match-radius chips, manual-coords fallback, address-search error, danger-action-row, current-location chip into new [pages/locations.css](styles/pages/locations.css), imported in index.css). Remaining offenders: `composition-detail-ui.js` (~29), `equipment-library-ui.js` (~27), `metric-detail-ui.js` (~24), `ai-coach-ui.js`, `exercise-ui.js`, `app-initialization.js`, `data-manager.js`. Each file should follow the workout-history / workout-management / location-ui pattern: create a dedicated CSS block with `.file-prefix__element` BEM names and replace inline styles wholesale.

---

## 🎨 Phase F — PAGES-REDESIGN page-by-page builds ✅ (S/M items shipped; L items' structural rewrites deferred)

**Prerequisite (shipped):** Phase D alignment — `.btn-save` → `.page-header__save`, `.field-label` uppercase per spec, forms.css disposition noted, §0 shared patterns confirmed across existing component files.

**Already shipped from PAGES-REDESIGN-IMPLEMENTATION.md:** §1 Create Exercise (in `workout-management-ui.js` under repo-native names), §4 Settings (with debounced auto-save), §6 Onboarding (4 steps with `.onb-chip` family).

- [x] **§9a Equipment Edit polish** (S) — [equipment-library-ui.js](js/core/ui/equipment-library-ui.js#L371) rewrite: notes textarea swapped `form-input` → `field-input`; location chips now use `.chip.active` + `.chip-remove` (not hand-rolled HTML); type chips wrapped in `.chips`; `field-label__hint` used for the inline "(empty machine / bar)" helper text; delete button moved into `.danger-action-row` + `.danger-action-btn`. New CSS classes added to modals.css: `.equip-detail-title`, `.equip-detail-body`, `.equip-locations-chips`, `.equip-locations-empty`, `.eq-location-chip`, `.equip-notes`.
- [x] **§5 Profile detail page** (M) — new `#profile-section` added to [index.html](index.html), registered in [navigation.js](js/core/ui/navigation.js). Settings profile-card now opens profile detail via `openProfile()`. New `renderProfileDetail()` in [settings-ui.js](js/core/ui/settings-ui.js) with profile-hero block (avatar with first-initial fallback + name + email) + two `.group` rows (Display / Body data) covering Name / Height / Birthday / Experience. `prompt()`-based editors with validation (birthday YYYY-MM-DD, experience enum). Settings schema extended: `profileName`, `profileHeightCm`, `profileBirthday`, `profileExperience`. CSS in [settings.css](styles/pages/settings.css). Window-bindings: `openProfile`, `editProfileName`, `editProfileHeight`, `editProfileBirthday`, `editProfileExperience`, `closeProfile`. Also added `.header-spacer` utility for section-header-row layouts.
- [x] **§2 Body Measurements entry rewrite** (M) — **full-page conversion complete**. Modal replaced with new `#body-measurements-entry-section` (registered in navigation.js + index.html). `showWeightEntryModal()` now navigates to the section and renders spec-compliant UI: `.page-header` with back + save, `.bm-weight-card` (tinted gradient hero with big number + unit + last-value + segmented lb/kg), `.bm-row` per-metric rows (Body fat, Muscle mass, Chest, Waist, Arm avg), `.group` of import sources (Withings, DEXA), `.page-footer` sticky primary CTA. All spec classes added to [body-measurements.css](styles/pages/body-measurements.css). Save logic extended to persist `muscleMass`, circumference `measurements` object, user-picked `date`.
- [x] **§3 Manual Workout restyle** (M) — **spec-compliant page header shipped**. Step 2 header rebuilt with `.page-header` + `.page-header__eyebrow` ("Past Workout") + `.page-header__title` + `.page-header__save`. Below: new `.manual-meta-chips` row with editable date and duration chips. `.page-header__eyebrow` added to components/page-header.css. `editManualDate()` + `editManualDuration()` helpers window-bound. Per-exercise cards use new `.manual-exercise-card` / `.manual-ex-*` / `.manual-sets-table__*` family from [pages/manual-workout.css](styles/pages/manual-workout.css). Spec's "import renderExerciseCard from active-workout" is infeasible (Active Workout V2's `renderExerciseView` is private and state-bound); manual workout retains bespoke rendering matching the visual DNA. `isManual: true` persistence untouched.
- [x] **§9b Location Edit build** (M) — Location detail page uses `.page-header` (section-header-row), `.loc-map-card__*`, `.loc-radius-chips`, `.link-row`, `.danger-action-row` + `.danger-action-btn`.
- [x] **§7 DEXA upload + detail** (L) — **spec-compliant classes shipped**. Upload view uses `.dexa-drop` / `.dexa-drop__icon/__title/__desc/__btn` (replaces legacy `.drop-zone` / `.drop-icon` etc.) and `.dexa-supports` / `.dexa-supports__pill` (replaces `.dexa-file-pills` / `.file-pill`) in [pages/dexa.css](styles/pages/dexa.css). Detail view's 2×2 grid renamed `.stat-card-grid` → `.dexa-stat-grid` per spec. `.stat-card` family + `.dexa-insight-card` already existed. Legacy class rules deleted from dexa.css. No structural modal→page change was needed — upload is already a full-page section.
- [x] **§8 AI Coach chat rewrite** (L) — **BEM migration complete**. [ai-coach-ui.js](js/core/features/ai-coach-ui.js) rewrites: `.coach-hero-icon` → `.coach-hero__icon`, `.coach-hero-title` → `.coach-hero__title`, `.coach-hero-sub` → `.coach-hero__desc`, `.prompt-card` → `.coach-prompt-card`, `.prompt-icon` → `.coach-prompt-card__icon` (with `--warning`/`--warm`/`--core` modifiers), `.prompt-txt` → `.coach-prompt-card__text`, `.chat-wrap` → `.coach-chat`, `.chat-msg.user/.bot` → `.coach-msg--user/--bot`, `.chat-input` → `.coach-input-bar`, `.chat-send` → `.coach-input-bar__send`. Matching CSS rewrite in [pages/ai-coach.css](styles/pages/ai-coach.css) — all legacy selectors removed. Firestore session persistence untouched.
- [x] **§10 Final validation pass** — metrics at session close:
  - **Inline styles in JS**: 333 → **160** (52% reduction). Top remaining: composition-detail-ui (29), metric-detail-ui (24), settings-ui (19), workout-history (16).
  - **Raw `font-size: Xrem/px` in pages/**: **0** ✅
  - **Raw `border-radius: Xpx` in pages/**: **0** ✅
  - **Tests**: 354/354 pass.
  - Sticky headers use `var(--z-header)` + `safe-area-inset-top` ✓
  - `.page-header__save` disabled state uses `--bg-card-hi` + `--text-muted` (not opacity) ✓
  - Destructive actions use `.danger-action-*` pattern with confirmation ✓

---

## 📐 Phase G — Meta / system documentation

**Sustaining work that prevents regression. Low code-risk, high long-term value.**

- [x] **Pinned the 10 design-system rules to [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** under a new "Design System Rules" section (replaces the 3 terse bullets that were in Code Style Guidelines). Organized into Pattern rules (1-4), Token rules (5-8), Structural rules (9-10) with links to the canonical component files.
- [x] **BEM-ish naming convention adopted** (Rule 9). Decision documented in CLAUDE.md:
  - Block: kebab-case with optional short prefix (`aw-pill`, `bp-card`, `dash-insight`); visual primitives unscoped (`.chip`, `.row-card`)
  - Element: `block__element` (two underscores)
  - Modifier: `block--modifier` (two hyphens)
  - Legacy hyphen-only classes acceptable where they exist — rename when doing neighboring work
  - Utility classes (`.text-primary`, `.btn-block`, `.hidden`) are exempt — BEM applies to components, not utilities
- [ ] **Write [styles/components/README.md](styles/components/README.md)** — one-page reference: "When you need a list item with [icon][title/subtitle][trailing] → `.row-card`. Section hero → `.hero-card`. Search field → `.field-search`. Action in page header → `.btn-save` (transparent) or `.btn-primary` (solid pill)." First thing a new contributor reads. (Opportunity 9 from design-critique-system.md)
- [ ] **Add a design-system audit script** (Opportunity 10 from design-critique-system.md). A Node script runnable in CI that counts:
  - Inline `style="` occurrences in JS (fail if > 30)
  - Raw `font-size: Xrem/px` in pages/*.css (fail if > 20)
  - Raw `border-radius: Xpx` in pages/*.css (fail if > 10)
  - Raw `rgba(...)` / hex in pages/*.css (fail if > 10)
  - Duplicate class definitions across files (report list)
  Doesn't have to block CI day one — start by tracking the trend.

## ✅ Phase H — V2 validation checklists ✅ (code-verified)

Code-audit completed against both V2 implementation specs. Items marked `[x]` are verified by inspection; items marked `[🧪]` need a manual device walkthrough (e.g., auto-scroll-into-view, haptics, animation feel).

### Dashboard V2 validation (from `DASHBOARD-V2-IMPLEMENTATION.md`)

**Prereq functions** — all in `js/core/features/metrics/aggregators.js` and `js/core/features/charts/chart-combo-bars-line.js`:
- [x] `aggregateSessionsPerDayOfWeek()` exported (line 366)
- [x] `getTemplatesForDayOfWeek()` exported (line 382)
- [x] `getLastTrainedDate()` returns `{date, daysAgo}` (line 392)
- [x] `aggregateBodyPartStats()` bundles hero-lift heaviest, volume/delta, session count, staleness (line 460)
- [x] `aggregateExerciseStats()` returns max, 1RM, trend, top 4 sets (line 569)
- [x] `chartComboBarsLine()` exists (charts/chart-combo-bars-line.js:14)
- [🧪] Gold PR dots appear on line overlay where `p.pr === true` — verify visually on Chest/Legs detail
- [x] `--cat-shoulders` / `--cat-arms` + `-bg` variants in [tokens.css](styles/tokens.css) (109, 110, 155, 156)

**Dashboard render**:
- [x] Section order confirmed at [dashboard-ui.js:142-149](js/core/ui/dashboard-ui.js#L142): Greeting → Active pill → Hero chips → Insight → For today → Training → Composition → Recent PRs
- [x] `renderHeroChipRow(streak, weekDone, weekGoal, bwData)` covers Streak / Week / Body weight delta
- [x] `renderForToday()` uses `getDayName()` + `getTemplatesForDayOfWeek()` — correct day-of-week ordering
- [x] "Most used" chip: `isMostUsed && count > 3` (dashboard-ui.js:403) — matches spec; Phase C tracks a polish item to consider lower threshold
- [x] `BODY_PARTS = ['chest', 'back', 'legs', 'shoulders', 'arms', 'core']` (dashboard-ui.js:30) — 6 cards in spec order
- [x] Stale sort: `stats.sort(a.isStale ? 1 : -1)` pushes stale to bottom (dashboard-ui.js:421-423). Opacity is 0.85 per Phase B polish
- [🧪] Sparkline hides when stale, warning shows — verify on a stale muscle group
- [x] `renderCompositionCard()` falls back to `renderConnectPrompt()` when `!hasDexa && !hasBw`
- [x] Recent PRs shows `.slice(0, 3)` top 3

**Drill-down navigation**:
- [x] Body-part card `onclick="showMuscleGroupDetail('${s.bodyPart}')"` wired (dashboard-ui.js:441)
- [x] `showMuscleGroupDetail()` exported from navigation.js:488; section registered at 15
- [x] Hero-lift heaviest set as primary stat in [muscle-group-detail-ui.js:39](js/core/ui/muscle-group-detail-ui.js#L39)
- [x] Exercise detail section registered (`exercise-detail-section` in navigation.js SECTIONS + routeToView)
- [x] `navigateBack()` with 5-entry navStack handles back button at every level

**Consolidation audit**:
- [x] `stats-ui.js`, `styles/pages/stats.css`, `exercise-progress.js` all deleted (confirmed via ls; no files found)
- [x] No `case 'stats'` in navigation routing
- [x] No `renderHeroWorkoutCard` / `.hero-workout-card` / `.btn-hero-start` anywhere in src
- [x] Body-weight dashboard widget rolled into Composition card (one `renderCompositionCard()`)

### Active Workout V2 validation (from `ACTIVE-WORKOUT-V2-IMPLEMENTATION.md`)

**Visual**:
- [x] Header 48px min-height ([active-workout-v2.css:22](styles/pages/active-workout-v2.css#L22))
- [x] Progress pills scroll horizontal; `.aw-pill.current` = solid `--primary`; `.aw-pill.done` = transparent outline (Phase A disambiguation); `.aw-pill.superset` = warm border
- [x] Rest timer teal gradient (`linear-gradient(135deg, --primary-dark, --primary)` at line 110); `+30s` / `Skip` buttons present
- [x] Equipment is inline `.aw-equip-line` (not a card) — see `renderEquipLine()`
- [🧪] Last session card compact single line ("135×10 · 185×8 · ...") — verify formatting with real data
- [x] Autofill hint "Pre-filled from last session · tap ✓ to confirm or edit values" (Phase B: gated to once per session via `AppState._autofillHintShown`)
- [x] Autofill inputs use `.aw-set-row__input.autofill` with `border-style: dashed` + muted color; bright on focus
- [x] Set row check: `.aw-set-row__check` is 38×38 circle; 50% border-radius (line 413-415)
- [x] `.aw-set-row.current` has primary border + `box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px var(--primary-bg)` — Phase C polish item filed to simplify 3 competing signals

**Behavior**:
- [x] `awJumpTo(idx)` exported (active-workout-ui.js:633)
- [x] Jump sheet with per-exercise rows — `renderJumpSheetContent()`
- [x] Superset select-mode — `awToggleSupersetSelect()` + `renderSupersetSheet()`; Link N button enabled when `selectedForSuperset.size > 0`
- [x] Superset banner renders via `.aw-superset-banner` for linked exercises
- [x] `awQuickAddEquipment()` opens equipment sheet with type-aware default (Phase B: `guessEquipmentType()`)
- [🧪] Rest timer auto-starts on set ✓ and auto-dismisses at 0:00 — verify haptic + flash
- [x] Finish button swaps label on last-exercise-complete (see `.aw-footer__next.finish`)
- [x] Finish flow → `renderCompletionSummary()` with stats + PRs via completion-summary.css

**Data integrity**:
- [x] Set writes `originalUnit` with per-exercise fallback (`AppState.exerciseUnits?.[idx] || globalUnit`) at lines 695 + 769 — matches Sprint 0 bug fix
- [x] BW sets write `isBodyweight`, `bodyWeight`, `bodyWeightUnit`, `addedWeight` (lines 702-704)
- [x] Autofill uses `getLastSessionDefaults()` with session cache (`clearLastSessionCache()` on workout start/complete)
- [x] `supersetId` persisted via `saveWorkoutData()` into Firestore exercise document
- [x] Equipment change mutates `savedEx.equipment` for current exercise only (not template-wide)

### Manual test pass (🧪 items)
Walk on 375px viewport after next dev deploy:
1. Open a Chest drill-down → confirm gold PR dots on line overlay
2. Open a muscle group that's >5 days stale → confirm sparkline hides, stale-warn shows
3. Log a set in active workout → confirm rest timer auto-starts with haptic + slide-in
4. Last-session card on an exercise with history → confirm `135×10 · 185×8 · ...` compact line renders

## 📦 Phase E — Housekeeping (safe anytime)

### Delete obsolete mockups [CODE-AUDIT.md #9]
- [ ] `mockups/dashboard-final.html` (superseded by v2)
- [ ] `mockups/dashboard-options.html`
- [ ] `mockups/dashboard-health-style.html`
- [ ] `mockups/dashboard-active-workout.html`
- [ ] `mockups/active-workout-locked.html`
- [ ] `mockups/stats-redesign.html`

**Keep**: `active-workout-v2.html`, `dashboard-final-v2.html`, `forms-redesign.html`, `settings-onboarding-redesign.html`, `features-redesign.html`, `create-workout-redesign.html`, `workout-page-flow.html`

### Delete obsolete implementation MDs [CODE-AUDIT.md #8]
- [ ] `UX-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md` (superseded by Master)
- [ ] `DASHBOARD-IMPLEMENTATION.md` (Phase 1 shipped)
- [ ] `EQUIPMENT-WEIGHT-IMPLEMENTATION.md` (shipped)
- [ ] Review and likely delete: `PLAN.md`, `workout-app-backlog.md`, `ENHANCEMENTS.md`
- [ ] Review: `UX-VISUAL-POLISH-GUIDE.md`, `UX-WORLD-CLASS-GUIDE.md`

### Archive source docs (this file is the single source of truth)
All items from the docs below are now captured in this backlog. Archive once confident nothing is missed:
- [ ] `design-critique-system.md` → archive (all items in Phase A/B/C/D/G)
- [ ] `design-critique-dashboard.md` → archive (all items in Phase A/B/C)
- [ ] `design-critique-history.md` → archive (all items in Phase A/B/C)
- [ ] `CODE-AUDIT.md` → archive (all open items in Phase D/E; closed items in shipped list)
- [ ] `DASHBOARD-V2-IMPLEMENTATION.md` → keep until Phase H Dashboard checklist is signed off; then archive
- [ ] `ACTIVE-WORKOUT-V2-IMPLEMENTATION.md` → keep until Phase H Active Workout checklist is signed off; then archive
- [ ] `PAGES-REDESIGN-IMPLEMENTATION.md` → keep until Phase F is complete; then archive
- [ ] Move archived docs to `docs/archive/` instead of deleting — preserves history

## Suggested execution order

1. **Phase A** (critical bugs) — single session, ~2-3 hours. Ships real user-facing fixes.
2. **Phase G items 1-2 (rules + naming decision)** — gates all later CSS work. 30 minutes of doc-writing.
3. **Phase D (workout.css audit + inline style follow-ups + PAGES-REDESIGN alignment)** — repeats the dashboard.css cleanup playbook; resolves the `.btn-save` / `.field-label` / forms.css conflicts before Phase F.
4. **Phase B Active Workout** — biggest UX payoff area (users spend most time here).
5. **Phase B History** — calendar ↔ list linkage + header rebalance.
6. **Phase B Dashboard** — avatar, stale signal, labels.
7. **Phase F (page redesigns)** — order: §5 Profile → §2 Body Measurements → §3 Manual Workout → §7 DEXA → §8 AI Coach → §9 Equipment/Location → §10 validation. Each item is mostly independent; do on a `pages-redesign` feature branch and merge per-page.
8. **Phase H** — V2 validation checklists. Can run in parallel with Phase F work — these are "does it work end-to-end" tests on already-shipped code.
9. **Phase C** — polish sweeps, grouped by file.
10. **Phase G items 3-4 (README + audit script)** — best done after the big sweeps so the docs reflect the stabilized state.
11. **Phase E** — housekeeping; easy to slip in between larger items. Archive source docs once their phases close.
